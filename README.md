Friday - AI Desktop Voice Assistant

A voice assistant that performs multiple tasks by just recognizing
your voice commands. Build using python.

Designed to interpret natural language voice commands and carry out tasks for the user.


E.g. A command such as "Open YouTube" would launch Chrome and will open yt, while "Email" would prompt us to send an email.
And the "send message" command, on the other hand, will open the Whatsapp web and send a message at the time we specify.
